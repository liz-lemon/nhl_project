# nhl_project

Welcome to my NHL analysis project.
I've collected player and goalie stats for every season from 2010 - 2019. 
My intent is to do some unsupervised learning to see if there are any underlying patterns or trends. 

I would also like to do some cleaning and feature engineering with Python before doing some visualizations in Tableau later on.
