Welcome to my NHL analysis project.

As an avid Maple Leafs fan and former player since the young age of 5, I've always wanted to explore NHL players and statistics.
Now, my intent is to do some unsupervised learning and supervised learning to see if there are any underlying patterns or trends in the season stats I have collected.

I would like to explore the following questions:
	1. Can you predict the final standing of a team based on player/goalie stats
	2. Do some players create more goals on less opportunities? (Shooting %, Goals v SOG)
	3. What kind of salary money do top scoring players garner? What do their stats look like? 
	4. Do powerplay specialists (high PP goals & assists) rank high in season points? 
	5. What teams have produced the highest scoring players? 
	6. What teams have produced the least amount of top scoring players?
	7. Are there relationships between player points, goalie stats and Stanley Cup winning teams? 
	
This list is not exhaustive nor fixed. My analysis may change along the way but my overall intent is to explore the data and see what kind of questions I can answer.
